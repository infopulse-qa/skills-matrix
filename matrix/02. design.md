# Test Design
Test case creation, test analysis, check list creating
## Trainee
- Knows the structure of Test Cases and difference with Check List
- Knows the main Test Design Techniques (Equivalence Partitioning (EP), Boundary Value (BV), Decision Table (DT), State-Transition (ST) -  knows 1 or 2)
- Can create Test Cases and Check Lists with help and directions from senior colleagues on positive and some negative cases
- Knows the difference between:
  - Test levels: Unit Testing, Integration Testing, System Testing, Release Testing, Acceptance Testing
  - Test types: Functional and Non-functional
## Junior
- Understands most commonly used test design techniques (EP, BV, DT, ST) and uses common test-design approaches when choosing test data
- Can do test design of readable test cases on positive and negative scenarios
- Knows how to investigate the issue and can provide the examples of:
  - Test levels: Unit Testing, Integration Testing, System Testing, Release Testing, Acceptance Testing
  - Test types: Functional and Non-functional
## Middle
- Able to identify and balance test-coverage
- Understands concept of test-levels and test-types
- Able to identify which test-cases are more reasonable to put on each test-level
- Can do test design on positive and all negative cases
- Knows IEEE standard for test design (29119 p4)
- Uses most common test design techniques (EP, BV, DT, ST)
- Can define test data
- Able to approach Non-Functional aspects of product by suggesting NFT approaches
## Senior
- Can review test cases/checklists of colleagues and mentoring/consulting them, has relevant experience
- Able to perform test-design based on a given requirements, or according to common sense and experience if exact requirements are missing
- Optimizes amount of test data required for Test Case execution
- Involves risk-based approach while test design
- As a plus - has preferred approach to the test analysis 
## Expert
- Identifies which test-design technique could be used in a specific case, based on experience and risks
- Supervises colleagues on different test design techniques, optimal approaches
- As a plus - has own approach to the test analysis and test design which is proven in 3+ projects
