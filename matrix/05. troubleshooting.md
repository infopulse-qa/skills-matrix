# Issue Investigation
Bug Reporting, defects localization, issue investigation
## Trainee
- Has theoretical knowledge of what is bug's structure and its life cycle
- Able to create bug report (fill all required fields), read it and reproduce the issue in the tracking system
- Knows the difference between: verification and validation
## Junior
- Able to create structured bug report with all required information
- Understands the difference between severity and priority
- Can perform defects localization
- Uses available tools to investigate the issue (logs, DBs, console and DevTools)
- Understands software structure and able to assume root cause reasons
## Middle
- Able to identify reasonable priority/severity
- Able to create structured bug report (additionally provides bug meta information: links, tags, builds, modules, childs, parents and details like logs, screenshots, used test data, etc.)
- Can investigate the issue and localize a bug without supervision
- Knows tools to assist on root cause analysis
## Senior
- Able to analyze impact of priority/severity
- Can localize defect in integrated systems
- Understands software structure and can investigate the root cause
- Cooperates with development team for analysis, follows-up on issue fixing progress
- Can read even poorly described bug reports and reproduce the issue
- Performs systematization of defects at the end of iteration
## Expert
- Does deep level investigation for the root cause; defines and mitigates potential weak areas ahead etc
- Participates in business issues investigation. Provides full information about bug location, including code refrences and related issues from the past
- Able to perform localization in unknown environment by collecting needed information
- Has deep understanding of systems logic and defect localization principles
- Performs systematization of defects at the end of iteration to contribute to lessons learned
