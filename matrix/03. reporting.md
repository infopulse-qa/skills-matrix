Test metrics
## Trainee
- Has basic theoretical knowledge of test reporting.
- Can report own activities for day, week, sprint (tests created, tests executed, bugs created, other activities).
## Junior
- Understands 1st level metrics (number): # of defects, # of TCs passed/failed, # of defects by their criticality, etc.
- Ð¡an explain what is Test Coverage, Test effort, Defect distribution, Test execution, Requirements and requirement coverage etc.
- Able to supply a report, based on a given template
## Middle
- Able to provide clear structural status for testing activities under own responsibility.
- Able to read report and understand current product quality.
- Understands 1st and 2nd level metrics (relative): pass/fail rate per module/feature, defects leakage rate (e.g. found on PROD/total found * 100%), etc.
- Creates different diagrams for completeness of the quality of testing using metrics.
## Senior
- Provides clear high and low levels structural overview of testing status for project. 
- Able to differentiate details of reports depending on the level of the target audience.
- Reports Product quality.
- Provides certain, precise, narrative and easy to understand the information in reports.
- Regularly collects metrics in daily work, analyses existing ones for improvements, implements them for practical usage.
- Understands 1st, 2nd and 3rd level metrics (distribution): defects leakage dynamics over iterations, dependency between # of defects and # of changes over iterations, etc...
- Collects information for metrics from different sources.
## Expert
- Able to define reporting standards and templates applicable for different deliveries, supervise others on the subject.
- Has own approach and style to report/present the quality, proven with good feedback in 3+ projects.
- Highlights the key things and gives a quick understanding of an information essence.
- Assures reports are highlighting only valuable information
- Can apply 1st, 2nd and 3rd level metrics to the current project, understands well how to collect them and how to use.
- Identifies gaps in reporting process and provides approaches based on test metrix for improving QA process and quality of tested application/product.
- Has practical experience of metrics alignment with stakeholder, implementation in 3+ projects.
